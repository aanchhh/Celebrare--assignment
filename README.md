I have created a fully functional text box that implements the following functions:- 
1. It changes/modifies the fonts of the text to three primary types- Sans, Snas Serif and Monospace.
2. It can change/modify the font-size to small, normal (which is set by deafult), medium, large.
3. It can bold, italic and underline selected text.
4. It can bullet point selected text or order it number-wise.
5. It can change the colour of the text, the user can choose from the given colour palette.
6. Undo/ Redo functions are present at the bottom, below the text-box which perform their respective functions.
7. "Add Text" button is present at the bottom, below the text-box, which allows the user to add text to the text-box.
8. The text-box has an aesthetically pleasing background image which provides a little personalized touch to the user and appelas to the user.
I built this application using Quill.js, to create the text-box and toolbar. HTML, CSS and JavaScript were the primarily used technology.
Additionally, I have also designed a navbar on top, that gives a general branding and idea to the user about our website.
